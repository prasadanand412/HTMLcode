It has received Breakthrough Device Designation from the US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA). Blindsight is being developed to enable individuals with total visual impairment due to damage to the optic nerve but with intact visual cortex to see, this is made possible by bypassing the optic nerve and directly stimulating the visual cortex to create a visual perception.</p>

    <h5>External CSS is a form of CSS which is used to add styling to multiple HTML pages at a time. It helps to design the layout of many HTML web pages simultaneously. The external CSS is always saved with the . css extension, and through this file, we can change the complete style of our HTML web page.</h5>

    <p id="paragraph">Prince Rupert's drops (also known as Dutch tears or Batavian tears) are toughened glass beads created by dripping molten glass into cold water, which causes it to solidify into a tadpole-shaped droplet with a long, thin tail. These droplets are characterized internally by very high residual stresses, which give rise to counter-intuitive properties, such as the ability to withstand a blow from a hammer or a bullet on the bulbous end without breaking, while exhibiting explosive disintegration if the tail end is even slightly damaged. In nature, similar structures are produced under certain conditions in volcanic lava and are known as Pele's tears.</p>
